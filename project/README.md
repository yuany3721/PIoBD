These PSI variants are base on the implementations from [BaRK-OPRF](https://github.com/osu-crypto/BaRK-OPRF).

Before you try to run these code, you should firstly try to run  [BaRK-OPRF](https://github.com/osu-crypto/BaRK-OPRF) project. If you can run this perfectly, then copy (we recommend that you should use cut) the **thirdparty** folder to the corresponding path in each folder. 

For example,  you can use`mv /BaRK-OPRF/thirdparty /PIoBD-CHV/project/Two_buckets/thirdparty` and then make & test the two-buckets PSI variant.

Although this operation looks a little weird, it's really easy to use.
